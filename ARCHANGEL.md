# Archangel

To enable `hidden cheat mode`, in multiplayer, type:
```
archangel up
```

To disable, type:
```
fall
```

With `hidden cheat mode` enabled, the following keyboard shortcuts work:

---

- **Key**: (mnemonic) _Description_

---

- **Alt-G**: (god) Toggle god mode
- **Alt-R**: (research) Complete all active research
- **Alt-P**: (power) Get 1000 power
- **Alt-U**: (units) Complete all units being constructed
- **Alt-D**: (destroy) Destroy the selected droid/structure
- **Alt-X**: (x-marks-the-spot) Heal/build the selected droid/structure
- **Alt-C**: (construct) Heal/build all structures
- **Alt-V**: (vehicle) Heal all droids
- **Alt-B**: (batch) Heal/build all structures/droids

---

P.S. We use the `left-alt` key for all of the keyboard shortcuts. The ones that have already been claimed are `H`, `S`, `T`, `A`, `K`. Everything is fair game though. I can't believe that a shortage of available keys is actually becoming a problem; this has become an insane number of different cheats.
